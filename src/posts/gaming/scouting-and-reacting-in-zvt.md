## Summary

A comprehensive guide that will continued to be updated through learning/balance patches/meta shifts.

## General (Stuff to always be doing)

### Zerglings üêú

- Leaving one outside the natural, third, and/or fourth to see moving out
- Leaving a couple patrolling on the map can spot so many incoming drops
- Leaving lings scattered at various bases to see when they are taking can help you deny these bases as the Terran player expands
- Burrowing Lings at bases to deny and scout for them
- Running Lings into the natural or other bases after the Terran player moves out at any time can provide critical scouting information and potentially some damage

### Overlords üéä

- Leaving Overlords spread across the map on ledges, after getting speed or if there is no Viking, can be significant in seeing Liberators, Banshees, and Drops coming from a mile away
- Leaving Overlords in dead air space (don‚Äôt necessarily need speed) can help with drops too
- During the early phases leaving Overlords just outside of your own natural and third, preferably on ledges, can help you see and react to Hellions quicker
- Use Overlords to spread creep at bases not taken yet by the Terran player to get scouting and deny or delay the expansion

## Timing Specific Scouting

### First Overlord straight to opponents natural

- Generally can sit this overlord on a ledge near the opponents natural
- Notice the time if you see the Reaper leaving the opponents base

If you see the Reaper leaving the base at 2:08, that means it is a gas first build. Because of this, it is highly unlikely the Terran player will build Marines, since they are trying to get their tech a little bit quicker, allowing you to just sit the first Overlord on top of their Barracks or Factory until you see the Barracks producing units.

- Some maps you can actually poke to check ramp without being killed if they build Marines if you pull back the minute you see tech/marine
- Always be glancing at this Overlord during your opening to see whats going on at natural (see units, buildings, etc‚Ä¶)

### Poke with Overlord at 3:15 to see opener

2Ô∏è‚É£ 1Ô∏è‚É£ 1Ô∏è‚É£

- 2 Barracks, 1 Factory, 1 Starport
- 16 marines + 2 Medivacs hit at ~5:00‚Äì5:15
- Defend with ~5 Queens (use all queens and replace them) + ~30 Lings

1Ô∏è‚É£ 1Ô∏è‚É£ 1Ô∏è‚É£

- 1 Barracks, 1 Factory, 1 Starport
- 4 Hellions usually hit at 4:00 defend with ~16 Lings
- Sometimes Cyclones instead of Hellions (check with overlord)
- Followed by some Banshee or Liberator or Medivac (Hellbat), place Sports at outside bases
- If Viking, it spawns at 4:00, pull back Overlords on map until getting speed or killing Viking

2Ô∏è‚É£ Factories

- Double Reactor = More Units, Hellbats/Cyclones
- Techlab Reactor = Blue Flame Hellions
- Hellion / Hellbat / Cyclone opening
- Generally need some combination of Roach, Queen, and/or Ravager to hold comfortably

3Ô∏è‚É£rd Base

- ~50% finished. This probably means CC after Factory before Starport 1‚Äì1‚Äì1, so you can pretty safely assume nothing crazy allin or heavy pressure is coming
- Finished 3rd CC. Probably a very greedy opening. You can safely drone as any pressure will be significantly delayed.

### Follow up scout with Overlord at 5:00

#### Check Composition

- Looking to see if they are going Bio/Mech
- Double upgrades of Engineering Bays or Armories can give this away too most of the time

3Ô∏è‚É£rd Base

- If it is ~50% finished when you are scouting, then it is a more standard third base timing after 1‚Äì1‚Äì1 or other opening
- Watch for some pressure, nothing too all in
- Take 4th + Macro hatch and drone up while defending the light/medium pressure

No 3Ô∏è‚É£rd Base

- Macro Hatch and saturate 3rd base
- Mass mostly Ling and Bane for Bio or Roach and Ravager for Mech
