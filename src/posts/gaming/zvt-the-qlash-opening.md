[Check out Part 2 of this QLASH series.](link-to-part-2)

## Summary

After watching Lambo’s most recent stream, I heard him mention how Reynor’s openings in ZvT throughout the series against Special were inferior to the QLASH opening…

This got me thinking about what exactly is The QLASH Opening? While QLASH does [have only Zerg players](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Team_QLASH), we often hear during casts, mostly from Rotterdam, about how what the current Zerg player is doing is QLASH-esque. Just an interesting side note because we don’t hear this kind of phrasing used for any other player on any other team.

Without further ado, we will analyze what exactly the ZvT QLASH opening is.

## Part 1: The normal stuff

- 13 Overlord

- 16 Hatchery\*

- 18 Gas (rally drone from egg)

- 17 Pool (rally drone from egg)

- 16 Rally next three drones to the gas

\*The 16 Hatchery might seem somewhat different to long time players. Instead of the 17 Hatchery, the 16 Hatchery will finish at the same time as your pool allowing you to start both Queens at the same time (so they finish at the same time). Also, earlier Hatch makes it a little easier to defend against proxies or rushes in all three races because your creep will spread faster.

## Part 2: The subtle deviation

- Drone until 21 supply

- @ 60 Gas — Take two drones off gas — send one to natural and the other to the third base

- 21 4 Zerglings (2 sets)+ 2 Queens

- 27 Use that drone you sent to the third to build the third

- 26 Overlord

- @ 100 Gas — Zergling Speed (don’t take out the single drone)

- @ 100% Queens — Larva inject main, creep tumor natural, start 3rd Queen in main

This is where things get a bit different from what we are used to, so here are a couple pointers and explanations…

The 2nd Overlord is WAY later than we are used to building; we don’t build it until after taking the third!

You leave one on gas so you have the faster 100 gas later in the game for the possible quick Lair if you need it

The 3rd Base timing is such that it won’t be denied by the Gas after Rax Reaper opening that most Terran players do

The creep tumor at the natural is important to connect the natural to the 3rd base
On maps where the reaper can jump into the main you want to block with lings if possible and send the Queen from the main to the natural, so you have both Queens defending pushing back the Reaper at the natural

## Part 3: The follow up

This is where things will begin the change depending on what the player is doing, but in most situations you will follow what is listed below…

- 33 Overlord

- 41 (3rd Queen just finished) — 2 additional Queens + 2 drones back on gas, making it 3 total

- 46 2 Overlords + Queen at 3rd

- ~3:50 — you should know what is coming whether it be a 1–1–1, 2–1–1, or a fast third, etc… and you can then start reacting appropriately

… From here you [react and play accordingly](https://keevandance.com/posts/scouting-and-reacting-in-zvt)...
