## Summary

This article could not have been written without the incredible new series, The Breakdown. The show is hosted by [ROOTCatZ](https://twitter.com/ROOTCatZ) in which he and the pro player of the week carefully and meticulously walk through pro players’ replays where the pro player (in this case SortOf) provides an insane amount of insight as to the decisions they make throughout the game. Watch the full episode [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emROSHmUaJA&list=PLWQGxRd6vVGjJwUA5pHmYSn5U6Cuin4jE).

To set the stage, SortOf analyses one of his replays against Dear which took place in the GSL Super Tournament Qualifers. This format will be more of a list of notes very similar to what I took down when I watched the episode.

- Lost and Found is a great Roach Hydra Drop map

Because of the positioning of the Main, Third, and Fourth Base, this map tends to be good when going for a Roach Hydra drop style play as opposed to Swarm Host or Hydra Ling Bane. The reasoning is that Lost and Found has a pretty safe 4 bases being that there is really only three choke points, all three relatively small, that lead into the Protoss’ bases. In two of the chokes, there are destructible rocks which can be broken down exposing a somewhat larger choke point, but nonetheless the choke point themselves still lend to an easy defense from the perspective of the Protoss player. The ledge between the Fourth Base and the Main Base tends to give some advantages to drop-heavy play over attacking in one location. For the Protoss player, splitting their army between their main base, third base, and possibly fourth base, can often times result in them losing key units because there is not enough support in one or more locations.

- Drone counter-micro is absolutely critical to the ZvP match up

What I mean by Drone counter-micro is when the Probe is harassing the mineral line and trying to move Drones off of patches. It is very minor, but critical at the same time, to make sure that it does not mess up your mining too much. To counter this form of harassment, you need to repeatedly click on the mineral patch that the probe is harassing with the Drone that is trying to mine. Instead of your Drone trying to find a new, empty mineral patch, he will start mining once the Protoss player moves the Probe away from the patch. This is important because if the Protoss player decides to do some Adept pressure, if you didn’t counter-act the Probe harass, you will not be able to get your third Queen out in time for the 2 Adept pressure, which could result in losing a couple extra Drones.

- From my last guide on ZvP, we know that we need to check for Warp Gate starting, but what wasn’t mentioned, is that you need to check for the chrono on the Gateway

If you see the 2nd Chronoboost used on the Gateway, it is often times followed up with a 2 Adept pressure. If you see the second Chronoboost on the Gateway, the correct response is to leave the 4 Zerglings at home and build your 3rd Queen at 29 supply instead of 31 or 32. With this timing, the Queen should spawn right as the 2nd Adept arrives, allowing you to hold with little to no damage.

- After seeing the Stargate with your Overlord and you fly back to the natural to check the gas timing, if you see no double gas by the time the Overlord dies, it is pretty safe to assume that it will not be a double Stargate follow up

Because of the later gas, you can mostly eliminate this build. However, you should throw down your Roach warren at 4:00 to counter the incoming Adept pressure or Archon Drop that will be coming.

- After denying the double Adept pressure (if there was any) you should build 1 or 2 more sets of Zerglings and then spreading them across the map to gain as much vision as possible

After your first Overlord dies, you are generally in the dark until later in the game. Because of this, it is critical to your survival that you do not lose these Zerglings, but instead spread them around the Protoss base. This will allow you to spot anything that moves across the map, whether it is a Warp Prism leaving the main base, a group of Adepts leaving the natural, or a group of Phoenix leaving the main base.

- Vs Archon Drop or Adept pressure, you do not want to build Roaches until you see the Warp Prism or Adepts leaving the base

If you react quick enough to seeing either leaving the base, you will have Roaches spawning right when they arrive. This is important because if they don’t do either of these strategies and are instead doing something like a double Stargate Phoenix, building Roaches blindly will put you very far behind.

- If the opponent is going for Adept pressure, you want to build about 8–10 Roaches and then flood with Lings

Ideally you will take minimal damage from this. Unfortunately, there is almost always some amount of damage done with this timing, but because there are so many Adepts the Protoss player is delaying their Immortals and Storm. Because of this, if you take minimal damage, you will be on ~55–60 drones which allows you to follow up with a Roach + Ravager timing attack that could possibly end the game.
