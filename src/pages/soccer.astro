      I grew up playing soccer my whole life. As a kid, I often went back and forth between city recreational leagues, and what we called "travel"
      teams. Because my hometown was fairly small, there wasn't a big enough pool of players to support club soccer, so as a club team, we only ever
      played games by travelling to Phoenix or San Diego, hence the term "travel" team (not sure if this is a common term in other places, but I have
      heard "club" team a lot). This lasted until around high school where most of the players, myself included, ended up transitioning into high school
      soccer.

      Around this time, I kind of lost interest in soccer and would eventually quit and not really pick it up again until post-college where I would only play
      a couple games a year in an adults league with some friends. Fast forward to today, I moved to Korea where a friend invited me to come play on their weekly
      team. Since then, I have been playing pretty much every Saturday usually around 6AM.

      The purpose of this page, is mostly for myself to keep a short little journal of the games that I play with a picture or two attached as well.
